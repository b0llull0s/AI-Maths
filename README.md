# AI Mathematics Resource

This repository serves as a resource and learning practice for the mathematics used to train and develop AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Mathematical Concepts

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication, transpose, inverse, determinant, and eigenvalues.
- **Probability**: Conditional probability, expectation, variance, standard deviation, covariance, and correlation.
- **Calculus**: Derivatives, integrals, and their applications in optimization.
- **Optimization**: Gradient descent, convex optimization, and other optimization techniques.
- **Information Theory**: Entropy, KL divergence, and mutual information.

## Python Scripts

Each mathematical concept is accompanied by a Python script that illustrates the concept with code. The scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory.

## Examples

Jupyter notebooks with practical examples and applications of the mathematical concepts are provided in the `examples/` directory.
